- **Not tested**: No test file exists

## Notes

### KWD Service Test Success Details
The KWD (Keyword Detection) service has been fully tested with:
- Comprehensive unit tests with mocked components
- Edge case handling (empty audio, buffer management, multiple wake words)
- Real microphone integration test with actual OpenWakeWord model
- Cooldown functionality to prevent multiple detections from single utterance
- Dynamic RMS threshold adjustment
- Audio feedback (beep sound) on detection

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating the service's reliability in both isolated and real-world scenarios.

### TTS Service Test Success Details
The TTS (Text-to-Speech) service has been fully tested with:
- Comprehensive stress testing with VRAM constraints (1.5GB free)
- Real audio output verification with 10-sentence long text
- VRAM monitoring during playback showing stable memory usage (0.53GB allocated, 8% GPU utilization)
- Text chunking and buffering validation for seamless audio playback
- GPU memory management under constrained conditions
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Threading performance for concurrent audio generation and playback
- Fixed critical API bug (tokenizer attribute issue) during testing

The service completed a 60-second stress test successfully with consistent memory usage and high-quality audio output.

## Quick Reference
- ✅ Fully tested: kwd_service.py, tts_service.py
- ✅ Test stubs exist: 10 services
- ❌ No tests: 12 services
